I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything
that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.

    bio: "I'm passionate about crafting dynamic web experiences, wielding the power of Node.js to bridge the gap between front-end and back-end development.  I take pride in building user interfaces that are not only visually appealing (think clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript , React) but also deliver smooth user interactions.  On the back-end, I focus on creating robust and scalable APIs that power those experiences.",
